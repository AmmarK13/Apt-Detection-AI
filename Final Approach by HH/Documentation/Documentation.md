## Data Transformation Process Documentation

### üìå Why Was Data Transformation Needed?

In any machine learning project, the trained model expects input data to match the format and features it was trained on. However, real-world test datasets can:

- Have **missing features**.
- Contain **NaN values** or unexpected data types.
- Include **extra, irrelevant columns**.
- Be **scaled differently** compared to the training set.

To ensure accurate predictions and fair evaluation, it was essential to **normalize the structure and content of the test data** before feeding it to the model.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How the Transformation Was Performed

1. **Feature Alignment:**
    
    - The model was trained using a fixed set of 60+ features.
    - A predefined list `model_features` was used to ensure the input to the model matches exactly.
    - Any missing feature in the test data was added using **sampled values from the training data** (`train_val.csv`) to retain realistic distributions.
2. **Handling NaN Values:**
    
    - For columns that existed but had missing values:
        - If the reference column had values, random sampling was used to impute realistic values.
        - If no reference values were found, a fallback fill value (e.g., `0`) was used.
3. **Feature Scaling (optional step depending on training):**
    
    - If the model was trained on standardized values, `StandardScaler` was applied to normalize the test data.
4. **Label Handling:**
    
    - The script first checked whether the `Label` column existed.
    - If present, it was extracted as ground truth (`y_true`) for evaluation.
5. **Prediction & Evaluation:**
    
    - Once transformed, the test data was passed to the model for predictions.
    - If labels were available, metrics like **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report** were generated.
    - If not, predicted labels were saved for manual review.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

1. **Feature Mismatch Between Datasets:**
    
    - Synthetic or external datasets often lacked several required columns.    
    - Solution: Programmatically added missing columns using statistically sampled values from reference data.
2. **Handling NaNs in Inconsistent Columns:**
    
    - Some features like `Flow Bytes/s` or `Packet Length Variance` frequently had NaNs due to calculation errors or zero divisions.
    - Resolution: Imputed from reference distributions or set to 0 if no data was available.
3. **Data Scaling Confusion:**
    
    - Difficulty arose when certain models behaved differently depending on whether `StandardScaler` was applied or not.
    - Mitigated by standardizing only when the training pipeline had used it.
4. **Unbalanced Labels in Synthetic Data:**
    
    - Evaluations on synthetic data showed significant drops in accuracy due to biased distributions.
    - Insight: Emphasized the importance of realistic synthetic generation or oversampling/undersampling techniques.
5. **Warnings from Scikit-learn:**
    
    - Example: `"X does not have valid feature names..."` due to `DataFrame` vs `array` mismatches.
    - Addressed by ensuring input is always a well-labeled DataFrame.

### üìä Summary

This transformation pipeline was a **critical bridge** between raw data and the machine learning model. Without it, even a well-trained model would produce poor results. The adaptive imputation strategy, careful feature selection, and robust error handling ensured reliable classification performance across both real and synthetic datasets.

#### **Data Transformation Documentation**

##### **Purpose of Transformation**

The raw input data could not be directly used for model inference due to several reasons:

- **Missing Features**: Not all required features were present in the incoming datasets.
    
- **Inconsistent Formats**: Some data points had missing values or unexpected distributions.
    
- **Model Requirements**: The trained ML model expects a specific set of preprocessed numerical features in a fixed format.
    

Hence, data transformation was **essential to bridge the gap between raw data and model input**.

##### **Steps in Transformation**

1. **Feature Selection**  
    A list of 59 specific features (`model_features`) was created. This list corresponds to what the trained model expects during inference.
    
2. **Handling Missing Columns**  
    For each expected feature:
    
    - If a column was missing in the test data, a random sample from the reference training data was used to fill it.
        
    - If the column existed but had NaNs, missing values were replaced by sampling from the non-NaN distribution in the training set.
        
3. **Consistency Filtering**  
    Extra, irrelevant columns were dropped, and only the features needed by the model were retained (`X_test = test_data[model_features]`).
    
4. **Label Extraction (Optional)**  
    If the test dataset had a `Label` column, it was separated as `y_true` for performance evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report.
    

##### **Challenges Faced**

- **Missing Data**: The most challenging part was dealing with incomplete test sets. Replacing missing values with random samples was a trade-off to maintain structural consistency.
    
- **Synthetic Data Drop in Accuracy**: When synthetic test datasets were evaluated, model performance dropped (e.g., accuracy dropped to ~71%), indicating domain shift or unrealistic distributions.
    
- **Consistency Enforcement**: Ensuring that feature order, names, and datatypes matched exactly was critical to prevent runtime errors and warnings from Scikit-learn.
    

##### **Outcome**

The transformation script ensured:

- Seamless model evaluation with real or synthetic datasets.
    
- High accuracy (up to 99.99%) on consistent datasets.
    
- Graceful handling of imperfect data, making the model robust to new inputs.
