⚠️ RST Flag Count has 2 values but is imbalanced (99.99% vs 0.01%).
⚠️ ECE Flag Count has 2 values but is imbalanced (99.99% vs 0.01%).
⚠️ Flow Bytes/s_IS_MISSING has 2 values but is imbalanced (100.00% vs 0.00%).

📉 Dropping low variance/imbalanced columns: ['FIN Flag Count', 'RST Flag Count', 'ECE Flag Count', 'Flow Bytes/s_IS_MISSING']
