 Protocol values          Attakcs    Benign
0                         0.000000  100.000000
6                         57.999033   42.000967
17                        0.000000  100.000000

these are the values that the protocol Column can take and since the values
are moslty skewed towards 6 this means having 0 and 17 are just meaning less
and after removing such values we are only left with 6 and since 6 is constant it provides no meaning
hence Protocol column should be removed
